This repository contains my diploma thesis for my undergraduate programme at the Military University of Technology in Warsaw.

## Abstract

The thesis (`thesis/document.pdf`) is Polish only.
However, I wrote an abstract in English that summarizes the contents of this work.

>The Internet has become a somewhat dangerous place for its virtual citizens.
>Today they must watch out for cyber threats like malware, but also their privacy is at risk all the time.
>Identification of Internet users became desirable as soon as the Internet became a mass media.
>Advertising platforms usually exploit identification to track users, and it is often possible to deanonymise them effectively.
>In this context, fingerprinting is a technique that allows web servers to uniquely identify user devices by examining information retrievable from a device or a browser, where this collection of information is unique for most instances.
>More vividly: unlike cookies and local storage, browser fingerprint stays the same in incognito/private mode and even when user purges browser data.
>It is, therefore, a stateless identification.
>Moreover, studies show that fingerprinting is also challenging to detect.
>
>This work aims to familiarise recipients with the concept of fingerprints, examine privacy/anonymity in their context and describe essential techniques in detail.
>Apart from the analysis of actively used techniques, the study focuses on the genesis of fingerprints, threats they bring and positive aspects of using another user identification method.
>
>The study also considers the effectiveness of fingerprinting techniques and possibilities of improving it.
>Since fingerprints tend to change with, for example, changing version of the browser, the proposed fingerprinting enhancement is to create a classifier to cluster similar fingerprints.
>The paper introduces a heuristic algorithm that uses Levenshtein distance to compute the cumulative difference between two fingerprints' textual components.
